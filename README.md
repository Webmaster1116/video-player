  A React component for playing a variety of URLs, including file paths, YouTube, Facebook, Twitch, SoundCloud, Streamable, Vimeo, Wistia, Mixcloud, and DailyMotion. Not using React? <a href='#standalone-player'>No problem.</a>
</p>

### Usage

```bash
npm install react-player --save
# or
yarn add react-player
```

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react'
import ReactPlayer from 'react-player'

class App extends Component {
  render () {
    return <ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysz5S6PUM-U' playing />
  }
}
```

Demo page: [`https://cookpete.com/react-player`](https://cookpete.com/react-player)

The component parses a URL and loads in the appropriate markup and external SDKs to play media from [various sources](#supported-media). [Props](#props) can be passed in to control playback and react to events such as buffering or media ending. See [the demo source](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player/blob/master/src/demo/App.js) for a full example.

For platforms like [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com) without direct use of `npm` modules, a minified version of `ReactPlayer` is located in `dist` after installing. To generate this file yourself, checkout the repo and run `npm run build:dist`.

#### Polyfills

* If you are using `npm` and need to support [browsers without `Promise`](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises) you will need a [`Promise` polyfill](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise).
* To support IE11 you will need to use [`babel-polyfill`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill) or a similar ES2015+ polyfill.

#### Autoplay

As of Chrome 66, [videos must be `muted` in order to play automatically](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17150870/google-chrome-autoplay-videos-sound-mute-update). Some players, like Facebook, cannot be unmuted until the user interacts with the video, so you may want to enable `controls` to allow users to unmute videos themselves.

### Props

Prop | Description | Default
---- | ----------- | -------
`url` | The url of a video or song to play<br/>&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Can be an [array](#multiple-sources-and-tracks) or [`MediaStream`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) object
`playing` | Set to `true` or `false` to pause or play the media | `false`
`loop` | Set to `true` or `false` to loop the media | `false`
`controls` | Set to `true` or `false` to display native player controls<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Vimeo, Twitch and Wistia player will always display controls | `false`
`volume` | Set the volume of the player, between `0` and `1`<br/>&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;`null` uses default volume on all players [`#357`](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player/issues/357) | `null`
`muted` | Mutes the player<br/>&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Only works if `volume` is set | `false`
`playbackRate` | Set the playback rate of the player<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Only supported by YouTube, Wistia, and file paths | `1`
`width` | Set the width of the player | `640px`
`height` | Set the height of the player | `360px`
`style` | Add [inline styles](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/inline-styles.html) to the root element | `{}`
`progressInterval` | The time between `onProgress` callbacks, in milliseconds | `1000`
`playsinline` | Applies the `playsinline` attribute where supported | `false`
`wrapper` | Element or component to use as the container element | `div`
`config` | Override options for the various players, see [config prop](#config-prop)

#### Callback props

Callback props take a function that gets fired on various player events:

Prop | Description
---- | -----------
`onReady` | Called when media is loaded and ready to play. If `playing` is set to `true`, media will play immediately
`onStart` | Called when media starts playing
`onPlay` | Called when media starts or resumes playing after pausing or buffering
`onProgress` | Callback containing `played` and `loaded` progress as a fraction, and `playedSeconds` and `loadedSeconds` in seconds<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;eg `{ played: 0.12, playedSeconds: 11.3, loaded: 0.34, loadedSeconds: 16.7 }`
`onDuration` | Callback containing duration of the media, in seconds
`onPause` | Called when media is paused
`onBuffer` | Called when media starts buffering
`onSeek` | Called when media seeks with `seconds` parameter
`onEnded` | Called when media finishes playing
`onError` | Called when an error occurs whilst attempting to play media

#### Config prop

As of version `0.24`, there is a single `config` prop to override the settings for the various players. If you are migrating from an earlier version, you must move all the old config props inside `config`:

```jsx
<ReactPlayer
  url={url}
  config={{
    youtube: {
      playerVars: { showinfo: 1 }
    },
    facebook: {
      appId: '12345'
    }
  }}
/>
```

The old style [config props](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player/tree/v0.23.0#config-props) still work but will produce a console warning:

```jsx
<ReactPlayer
  url={url}
  youtubeConfig={{ playerVars: { showinfo: 1 } }}
  facebookConfig={{ appId: '12345' }}
/>
```

Settings for each player live under different keys:

Key | Options
--- | -------
`youtube` | `playerVars`: Override the [default player vars](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters?playerVersion=HTML5)<br />`preload`: Used for [preloading](#preloading)
`facebook` | `appId`: Your own [Facebook app ID](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register#app-id)
`soundcloud` | `options`: Override the [default player options](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/html5-widget#params)<br />`preload`: Used for [preloading](#preloading)
`vimeo` | `playerOptions`: Override the [default params](https://developer.vimeo.com/player/embedding#universal-parameters)<br />`preload`: Used for [preloading](#preloading)
`wistia` | `options`: Override the [default player options](https://wistia.com/doc/embed-options#options_list)
`mixcloud` | `options`: Override the [default player options](https://www.mixcloud.com/developers/widget/#methods)
`dailymotion` | `params`: Override the [default player vars](https://developer.dailymotion.com/player#player-parameters)<br />`preload`: Used for [preloading](#preloading)
`twitch` | `options`: Override the [default player options](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/embed)
`file` | `attributes`: Apply [element attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video#Attributes)<br />`forceVideo`: Always render a `<video>` element<br />`forceAudio`: Always render an `<audio>` element<br />`forceHLS`: Use [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) for HLS streams<br />`forceDASH`: Always use [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) for DASH streams<br />`hlsOptions`: Override the [default `hls.js` options](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js/blob/master/docs/API.md#fine-tuning)

##### Preloading

When `preload` is set to `true` for players that support it, a short, silent video is played in the background when `ReactPlayer` first mounts. This fixes a [bug](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player/issues/7) where videos would not play when loaded in a background browser tab.

### Methods

#### Static Methods

Method | Description
------ | -----------
`ReactPlayer.canPlay(url)` | Determine if a URL can be played. This does *not* detect media that is unplayable due to privacy settings, streaming permissions, etc. In that case, the `onError` prop will be invoked after attemping to play. Any URL that does not match any patterns will fall back to a native HTML5 media player.
`ReactPlayer.addCustomPlayer(CustomPlayer)` | Add a custom player. See [Adding custom players](#adding-custom-players)
`ReactPlayer.removeCustomPlayers()` | Remove any players that have been added using `addCustomPlayer()`

#### Instance Methods

Use [`ref`](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) to call instance methods on the player. See [the demo app](src/demo/App.js) for an example of this.

Method | Description
------ | -----------
`seekTo(amount)` | Seek to the given number of seconds, or fraction if `amount` is between `0` and `1`
`getCurrentTime()` | Returns the number of seconds that have been played<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Returns `null` if unavailable
`getSecondsLoaded()` | Returns the number of seconds that have been loaded<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Returns `null` if unavailable or unsupported
`getDuration()` | Returns the duration (in seconds) of the currently playing media<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Returns `null` if duration is unavailable
`getInternalPlayer()` | Returns the internal player of whatever is currently playing<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;eg the [YouTube player instance](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Loading_a_Video_Player), or the [`<video>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element when playing a video file<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Use `getInternalPlayer('hls')` to get the [hls.js](https://github.com/video-dev/hls.js) player<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Use `getInternalPlayer('dash')` to get the [dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js) player<br />&nbsp; ◦ &nbsp;Returns `null` if the internal player is unavailable

### Advanced Usage

#### Responsive player

Set `width` and `height` to `100%` and wrap the player in a [fixed aspect ratio box](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes) to get a responsive player:

```js
class ResponsivePlayer extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <div className='player-wrapper'>
        <ReactPlayer
          className='react-player'
          url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysz5S6PUM-U'
          width='100%'
          height='100%'
        />
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```

```css
.player-wrapper {
  position: relative;
  padding-top: 56.25% /* Player ratio: 100 / (1280 / 720) */
}

.react-player {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
}
```

See [`jsFiddle` example](https://jsfiddle.net/e6w3rtj1/)

#### Single player imports

If you are only ever playing a single type of URL, you can import individual players to keep your bundle size down:

```jsx
import YouTubePlayer from 'react-player/lib/players/YouTube'

<YouTubePlayer
  url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46Azg3Pm4c'
  playing
  controls
  // Other ReactPlayer props will work here
/>
```

See a list of available players [here](https://github.com/CookPete/react-player/tree/master/src/players).

#### Standalone player

If you aren’t using React, you can still render a player using the standalone library:

```html
<script src='https://cdn.rawgit.com/CookPete/react-player/standalone/dist/ReactPlayer.standalone.js'></script>
<script>
  const container = document.getElementById('container')
  const url = 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46Azg3Pm4c'

  renderReactPlayer(container, { url, playing: true })

  function pausePlayer () {
    renderReactPlayer(container, { url, playing: false })
  }
</script>
```

See [`jsFiddle` example](https://jsfiddle.net/krkcvx9s/)

#### Adding custom players

If you have your own player that is compatible with ReactPlayer’s internal architecture, you can add it using `addCustomPlayer`:

```javascript
import YourOwnPlayer from './somewhere';
ReactPlayer.addCustomPlayer(YourOwnPlayer);
```

Use `removeCustomPlayers` to clear all custom players:

```javascript
ReactPlayer.removeCustomPlayers();
```

It is your responsibility to ensure that custom players keep up with any internal changes to ReactPlayer in later versions.

#### Using Bower

```bash
bower install react-player --save
```

```html
<script src='bower_components/react/react.js'></script>
<script src='bower_components/react/react-dom.js'></script>
<script src='bower_components/react-player/dist/ReactPlayer.js'></script>
<script>
  ReactDOM.render(
    <ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46Azg3Pm4c' playing />,
    document.getElementById('container')
  )
</script>
```

#### Mobile considerations

Due to various restrictions, `ReactPlayer` is not guaranteed to function properly on mobile devices. The [YouTube player documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference), for example, explains that [certain mobile browsers require user interaction](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Mobile_considerations) before playing:

> The HTML5 `<video>` element, in certain mobile browsers (such as Chrome and Safari), only allows playback to take place if it’s initiated by a user interaction (such as tapping on the player).

#### Multiple Sources and Tracks

When playing file paths, an array of sources can be passed to the `url` prop to render multiple `<source>` tags.

```jsx
<ReactPlayer playing url={['foo.webm', 'foo.ogg']} />
```

You can also specify a `type` for each source by using objects with `src` and `type` properties.

```jsx
<ReactPlayer
  playing
  url={[
    {src: 'foo.webm', type: 'video/webm'},
    {src: 'foo.ogg', type: 'video/ogg'}
  ]}
/>
```

[`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) elements for subtitles can be added using `fileConfig`:

```jsx
<ReactPlayer
  playing
  url='foo.webm'
  config={{ file: {
    tracks: [
      {kind: 'subtitles', src: 'subs/subtitles.en.vtt', srcLang: 'en', default: true},
      {kind: 'subtitles', src: 'subs/subtitles.ja.vtt', srcLang: 'ja'},
      {kind: 'subtitles', src: 'subs/subtitles.de.vtt', srcLang: 'de'}
    ]
  }}}
/>
```
